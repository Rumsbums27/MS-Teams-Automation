## MS-Teams-Automation

---

### Requirements:
1. PyAutoGUI
2. Python 3.8 or higher
3. A Screenshot of your MS-Teams Icon on your Desktop
4. Screenshots of all Meetings you want to automate
5. These Screenshot you have to name like `meeting_<hour>-<minute>-<latency>`

You have to put the screenshot of your MS-Teams Icon in the `images` Folder. Then you have to name this `.PNG` File
to `teams.PNG`. Alternatively you can use the given `teams.PNG`. You also can replace all the settings pictures but this
could give you an error.
